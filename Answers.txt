1.  We now specify at the beginning of section II A that the pathway we describe there is intra-cellular. Our tool is indeed more suited to modelling intra-cellular pathways, but it is still
    possibe to model other types of pathways.
2-4 have been addressed in the text.
5.  We added in the conclusions an example on how stochastic behaviour could be implemented in a model. Currently, UPPAAL supports only uniform and exponential distributions, but in principle
    its authors could extend it with support for other popular distributions, as its stochastic analysis engine is simulation-based (i.e., it performs statistical model checking).
    Regarding the introduction of stochastic dynamics to specifically model certain reactions or situations, we are not currently planning to reach that level of detail in our models.
    As stated in section III A, third paragraph, we aim at providing the biologists with a modeling paradigm that is not parameter-intensive. So instead of modeling the single reactions such as
    E + S + ATP <--> ES + ATP --> ES* + ADP <--> E + S* + ADP (where E is an enzyme, S a substrate, S* the phosphorylated substrate, and ATP is the source of the phosphate group), we model
    abstract "reactions" (we could call them interactions) such as E --> S, which we read as "E activates S". Thus, we substitute the (sometimes large) set of kinetic parameters required to represent
    a typical reaction by a single-parameter abstract kinetic formula (i.e., the three scenarios presented in section III B).
6-8 have been addressed in the text.
9.  For the sake of space, we cite only a small number of tools. As the authors of [1] correctly point out, there are indeed tens of worthy tools in this field. However, listing any and all
    alternatives to our approach seemed to take up a serious amount of precious space, especially considering that the main objective of our paper is not providing a review of existing approaches.
10. If by "default settings" we intend the abstract reaction kinetics, we could indeed extend ANIMO with the possibility to define more interaction scenarios. This would give the user a
    wider range of choices when defining the abstract kinetic properties of reactions. However, for the moment we are focusing more on network topologies than detailed reaction kinetics.
    It is mainly for this reason that the current version of ANIMO contains only basic abstract kinetic formulae.
    If the "default settings" include also the underlying Timed Automata model, currently there is only way to change it. This can be done by manually opening the models generated by ANIMO
    and editing them using the UPPAAL user interface (Figures 1 and 2 are exported from UPPAAL). This way of "personalizing" models adds much potential to the modelling power available to
    the user. However, this happens at the price of exposing the user directly to the Timed Automata formalism (even if in its graphical representation). Also, we should note that any modifications
    or additions to a Timed Automata model generated by ANIMO will not be reflected in any other models generated by our tool. This somewhat hampers the work of a user interested deeper
    investigations on multiple models, as the same modifications would need to be manually applied to any model automatically generated by ANIMO.

1. A user-friendly interface for building models with Timed Automata (i.e., a feature comparable to the main contribution of Snoopy) is already present and implemented in UPPAAL:
   Figures 1 and 2 come in fact directly from UPPAAL's user interface. The aim of ANIMO is not to offer a novel way to represent Timed Automata, but a way to allow a user to exploit the power
   of an unfamiliar formalism for modelling biological pathways. We could have chosen another formalism to represent the dynamics of the reactions, but we decided to focus on Timed Automata
   because they are not as parameter-intensive as differential equations, while still keeping a quantitative measure in the form of clocks.
   CellIllustrator is indeed a very powerful tool for modeling pathways including some quantitative dynamics, however the tool is not widely accessible. Its non-free nature, combined with some
   technical uncertainties (the .jar applications to be used from the web site are not signed, thus preventing their use under many platforms), is in our opinion a limiting factor for the
   widespread use by a biological modelling community.

2. While we agree that a choice on the granularity of some key reactants may influence the behavior of a whole network, we are not sure that a biologist completely lacks familiarity with
   the concept of "arbitrary units". That concept is commonly used when reporting experimental measures such as those coming from microarray experiments. Deciding a scale or granularity for such
   measures is often implicitly done by the experimental biologist. When we define our users "inexperienced", we refer to inexperience in the field of mathematical formalisms. While modelling
   experience is not strictly required to profit from our modelling approach, an understanding of how wet-lab measurements are represented is certainly an advantage to better exploit
   the modelling of biological networks.

3. ANIMO's graphical user interface is used to abstract from the actual Timed Automata model. The interested user can still access the underlying models and modify them in UPPAAL, which provides
   the necessary features to do so. As stated in answer nr. 1, we could have chosen to hide another formalism under the user interface, and that would not have changed the way our users would
   interact with the tool. Again, our choice fell on Timed Automata because with them we can achieve the level of detail we are aiming for.
   We find it difficult to understand how a (non-trivial) model of the dynamics of a biological network could be represented in a formalism like Petri Nets and still be "the same" as the
   original network, in the sense of looking similar to the signalling/metabolic/gene network pictures commonly found in biology text books.

4. When we claim that our approach is "intuitive", we refer to the user interface, i.e. the Cytoscape plug-in. How the model is built with Timed Automata is not intended to be intuitive nor easily
   understandable by a non experienced user. The objective of the Timed Automata model is to be "close enough" to reality to provide the user with insights in the dynamics of a biological network.

5. Has now been addressed in the text: we briefly illustrate in the conclusions section the way in which we plan to provide a support for parameter fitting.
