This paper presents the application of Timed Automata via ANIMO tool on the modelling of intra-cellular signalling pathways. The overall objective is to help modellers (especially those with not a strong mathematical/computational background) to analyse such biological pathways via a user friendly environment. This is made more clear through the presented case study. The paper has a good and clear structure, and therefore, I suggest that authors make some minor revisions, listed below, before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.

*ISSUE*
1. Page 1, column 2, line 58 & page 2, column 1, section II (A) should be more precise that you will mainly refer to a particular category of biological pathways; that is, intra-cellular molecular pathways. Biological pathways have a more broad meaning: intra-, inter-, and extra-cellular pathways.

*OUR REPLY*
ANIMO is indeed suited best for modelling intra-cellular pathways, although it can also handle extracellular autocrine signalling. Upon your suggestion, we now specify at the beginning of section II A that the pathway we describe there is intra-cellular.

5. Page 3, column 2, in paragraph starting at line 27, where you are referring about natural variability, you can refer at this point more explicitly how you could incorporate stochasticity, as you refer on that as a future extension in the last page. As an example of stochastic behaviour, could you introduce a stochastic element regarding ligand-receptor binding and how this could impact the downstream effects (?)

*OUR REPLY*
Upon your suggestion, in the conclusions section we have now elaborated on a possible future implementation of stochastic elements in ANIMO models. Currently, UPPAAL supports only uniform and exponential distributions, but in future versions, UPPAAL developers might extend it with support for other popular distributions.
Regarding the introduction of stochastic dynamics to specifically model ligand-receptor binding, we are not currently planning to reach that level of detail in our models. As we explain in section III , our primary aim is to provide biologists with an intuitively accessible modelling approach. A series of abstractions from biological details reduces the number of parameters needed, while preserving cause-and-effect relationships. This modelling approach allows capturing the dynamics of larger systems in a semi-quantitative manner, at the cost of abstracting from the detailed molecular mechanisms. Modelling the stochasticity of ligand-receptor binding is currently beyond the scope of ANIMO models.

9. Page 6, column 2, in paragraph starting at line 43 or later during the discussion. Although the authors have referred to Copasi, E-cell, GNA, they should also refer to Systems Biology Workbench, CellDesigner, Bionetgen and make a comparison of ANIMO with those.  What is the additional value of this tool compared to those (existing tools)? Answering such a question would place this modelling tool in a broader context.

*OUR REPLY*
There are indeed many worthy tools in the field of computational modelling. A good review of these tools was given in [1]. Upon your suggestion we have added references to Systems Biology Workbench and CellDesigner, as well as a brief description. Due to strict page limits for IEEE J-BHI manuscripts and a primary focus on presenting a novel modelling method, a more extensive review of existing tools is beyond the scope of this paper.

*OUR REPLY*
Upon your comment and to save space, we have rewritten the section that included the phrase "mathematical details of the underlying model are hidden under the hood".
It is indeed possible to access the underlying Timed Automata model. This can be done by manually opening and editing ANIMO models in the UPPAAL user interface. Figures 1 and 2 are examples of TA models that are exported from UPPAAL. This way of "personalizing" models adds much potential to the modelling power available to the user. However, detailed knowledge of the TA formalism is needed in order to make meaningful changes to the model, even in its graphical representation in UPPAAL. Currently, modifications or additions to a Timed Automata model generated by ANIMO will not be directly reflected in other models generated by our tool. For these reasons, we chose not to mention this option or encourage the user to adapt the underlying TA model in this paper.

Comments to the Corresponding Author
Summary:

This paper introduces a new tool, ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive MOdelling) which is based on the formalism of timed automata (TA). The authors explain how a signalling pathway is implemented in a TA, and how the friendly user interface abstracts the user from implementation details. The tool is implemented as a plug-in to Cytoscape in order to ensure interoperability within the community, which is a very positive point for this work. In general, this is a  good piece of work, that presents a new modelling tool and a properly designed case-study.

Issues:

*ISSUE*
- The authors begin by distinguishing two modeling domains: ODE models, and "executable models" which are based on computational modeling formalisms used to model complex systems (eg: process calculi and automata). The reason claimed for building this tool is the current lack of user-friendly tools for this type of modelling formalisms, which require a more theoretical/mathematical training. This is not true, as one can take the example of the Petri net formalism, which also falls within this category, and where user friendly tools such as Snoopy (Heiner et al, 2012) and CellIllustrator (Nagasaki et al, 2010) exist.

*OUR REPLY*
Cell Illustrator is indeed a powerful tool for modelling pathways including quantitative dynamics. The graphical aspect is very detailed and allows to produce illustrations that closely match the ones found in biology books. We have chosen Cytoscape, since it is a free tool that is already widely used by system biologists, and our analysis process could be implemented easily as a plug-in. Upon your suggestion, we added a short description of Cell Illustrator, as well as a reference. 
UPPAAL is a user-friendly interface for building models with Timed Automata (Figures 1 and 2 are taken directly from the UPPAAL user interface). In that sense it is very comparable to Snoopy, which is an interface to construct Petri net models. But building a meaningful biological model in a tool such as UPPAAL or Snoopy does still require a biologist to abstract from the domain-specific language used for describing signalling networks. ANIMO exploits the Cytoscape user-interface that is familiar to biologists, to avoid direct interaction with the Timed Automata formalism, with which most biologists will not be familiar.
In an attempt to stay as close as possible to the typical representation of biological networks, ANIMO uses a different level of abstraction, resulting in fewer nodes in the network. This is now more clearly expressed in the paper. We do not think or claim that our approach is necessarily better than Cell Illustrator. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the level of precision desired by the user. One could argue that modelling in ANIMO is more accessible to biologists as a first step towards modelling their biological system.
We could have used different underlying formalisms with similar results, and we do not think or claim that TA are superior to other formalisms. The main reason for choosing TA over other formalisms is that the quantitative timing properties that are inherent to TA in the form of clocks make them well suited to model temporal dynamics of networks.

--------------------------------

*ISSUE*
- Also, the claim that ANIMO abstracts the non-mathematicaly-inclined user from implementation details is not intirely true. The user has to select the proper level of granularity for each variable (which can vary from binary to 100 levels in arbitrary units) which, depending on the sensitivity of the system to some of the variables, may significantly affect the results. This is the kind of non-intuitive insight that requires an experienced modeler.

*OUR REPLY*
Modelling always requires expertise. ANIMO requires expertise at the level of the system biologist, without a need to understand the underlying mathematical formalism. Granularity levels have to be chosen with care, but the user can easily experiment with different settings and get immediate feedback on his choice. We further addressed this point by rephrasing the end of Section III A.

--------------------------------

*ISSUE*
- The claim that automata and other concurrency-based formalisms are more modular that ODE's, hence better suited to build complex models is true. However, the TA formalism presented has a rather complex implementation (shown by the very convoluted representation in Fig 2). Although the graphical interface abstracts the user from the complexity of the implementation (compare Fig 3 to Fig 2), it is not clear why this formalism is more appropriate for the implementation of signalling networks, comparing for instance to a stochastic Petri net, where the biological network representation and the actual implementation are the same.

*OUR REPLY*
As the reviewer correctly points out, Timed Automata is not the only formalism suited for modelling biological systems. As we expressed in reply to the first comment, we do not think or claim that TA are superior to other formalisms. Some of the basic characteristics of TA, such as the clocks that can be directly related to real-time, are very suited to model temporal dynamics of concurrent systems, which is one of the reasons for choosing TA.
The TA model automatically generated by ANIMO is indeed an intricate piece of work. The templates allow for different kinetic scenarios, and reactants with different granularities in order to give a quantitative description of network dynamics. These templates can indeed be difficult to understand for users without knowledge on TA. The ANIMO interface was built also to shield the user from these templates, and the user only interacts with network representations in the Cytoscape interface. Having a direct match between the network representation and the underlying model is less important to the user, when he can interact directly with a representation with which he is familiar. In that sense Cell Illustrator takes a similar approach, hiding some of the details of Petri nets (such as tokens) from the user. As we expressed in our reply to the first comment, using the exact network representation in Cytoscape can be an appealing aspect to beginning users. Cell Illustrator uses extra boxes for processes and separate nodes for different states of the same protein, which is already more detailed than network diagrams in biological text book. Depending on the aims and background of the user, this can be both an advantage or a disadvantage. In that respect, ANIMO and Cell Illustrator each have their merits. Upon your suggestion, we have given a brief comparison between Cell Illustrator and ANIMO in the related work section.

--------------------------------

*ISSUE*
- One disadvantage of automata compared to other graph-based formalisms (eg: boolean networks, bayesian networks, petri nets), is the fact that nodes represent states rather than objects. This makes the representation of biochemical reaction networks a lot less intuitive. I would like to see a discussion on the relationship between timed automata and timed/stochastic petri nets, and a reason for choosing the former.

*OUR REPLY*
We agree on the fact that network representations where nodes depict objects are more intuitive than representations where nodes depict states. For this reason, Timed Automata are indeed not very close to the domain-specific language that is more familiar to the biologists. Therefore, we have chosen a completely different interface, Cytoscape, which has amply proven itself as a useful and intuitive interface for the representation of biological networks. This is the interface users are interacting with. In ANIMO representations, nodes depict objects, i.e. molecular species, whereas node colours depict the activity of these objects. In that way, all node colours together define the state of the network. By interactively using the time slider, the nodes change colour as the objects change their activity. We do feel that this animated view of network dynamics is much more familiar to biologists than plain Timed Automata. In discussions with collaborators, this feature is always perceived as very user-friendly and very suitable for presentation purposes.
An in-depth comparison between the formalisms at the foundations of ANIMO and Cell Illustrator does not fit the tight space constraints for the paper. It is also beyond the scope of the paper, which is to describe the technical foundations of ANIMO. An excellent comparison from the formal point of view is given in [1].

--------------------------------

*ISSUE*
- Compared to other formalisms, ODEs have the advantage of offering a variety of parameter fitting methods and tools (eg: the COPASI tool cited in the article). Formalisms such as automata, process calculi and petri nets, that were developed for the specification of concurrent systems, lack automatic parameter fitting methods, which does not allow the utilization of the experimental data to refine the models. In this work, the simulation results show a good agreement with the experimental data. However, as is common in all papers that propose alternative formalisms, the utilization of the data to fine-tune the model parameters is left as future work. I would consider this to be one of the current main problems in this field. Therefore I would like if the authors would elaborate some more regarding their ideas to address this problem.

*OUR REPLY*
Thanks for this very useful suggestion. We have now briefly outlined a future implementation of a parameter fitting method in the conclusions section of the paper. Upon your suggestion, we will give this implementation high priority in our future work.
